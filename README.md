Greetings, weary traveller. It is I, Ben Puusta, and this is my GitHub.

I'm currently learning computer wizardry with the School of code!  

I'm interested in  - making anything that works right now. Currently that means using Git, vsCode, javascript, html and CSS.
I also make music on the side using FL studio. 

Reach me on twitter at @benc0ded if you so wish.
